# Disk Maintenance Lab

Hands-on labs demonstrating essential disk maintenance tasks in Windows.  
This repository contains two separate labs: one focused on disk optimization and the other on removable drive formatting.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Windows Disk Management
- Windows 10/11
- FAT32 file system (used for USB formatting)
- Defragment and Optimize Drives utility

## 🔧 Lab 1: Defragmenting Disk C

In this lab, I optimized the performance of the system’s Hard Disk Drive by defragmenting the C: drive.  
Defragmentation reorganizes scattered data so the drive can access files more efficiently, improving overall system responsiveness.

I also configured a monthly automatic defragmentation schedule to ensure the disk continues to run efficiently without requiring manual maintenance.

## 💽 Lab 2: Formatting a Removable USB Drive

In this lab, I formatted a USB drive, assigned it the drive letter U, and selected the FAT32 file system.

FAT32 was chosen because of its broad compatibility across nearly all devices and operating systems, including:
- Windows  
- macOS  
- Linux  
- Game consoles  
- Smart TVs  
- Other consumer electronics  

This makes it ideal for removable storage intended for general use.
